And that's how it is with you. I almost understood, I almost had you within reach of my hand, my moment, the oasis of space that nourished and suddenly disappeared... That's how I see you and greatly value your art. It is like love that envelops but always leaves an unknown taste of longing... The passion and delicacy of the stroke that enchants me evokes emotions and shows that wanting is power. So I can have you in your painting to soon want more and differently... Is it still the same painting? Yes. Because you are a real woman with many changes. That's how I see those beautiful and ethereal strokes giving my imagination enormous food... although I would like you to just be on my ordinary gray wall.",

As the only woman in Poland, I introduced art into industry, painting personal works on dozens of silos in the explosion zone. My paintings have found their place in prestigious hotels, including Ohla Barcelona and Plaza Athénée in Paris. My appearances on the Dzień Dobry TVN program, including the portrait 'Sanitariuszka 19,' have garnered well-deserved attention from viewers. My works also adorn private collections, both in the country and abroad. I undeniably leave a lasting mark in the art world, with my signature black canvases and golden lines.",
  "description2": "You can have a beautiful interior that will definitely come to life and elevate your mood to a higher energetic level – an invaluable thing. Art is a spiritual necessity. It is not only a collector's sense but often a surprise, as we interpret it differently each time. Art can surprise even ourselves. In your surroundings, your gaze always directs horizontally, meaning in a room, it is always the wall you look at directly – this is our main field of vision, the rest being the peripheral field, less important for our sight. Similarly, when we look at a person, we focus on the face and eyes. So, how and what you want to see on the wall is up to you. Treat yourself to looking at an extraordinary painting, dreams, inspiration, something priceless.",
  "description3": "Art is a way for me to express myself through the medium of painting. I have been creating paintings for over 25 years. What sets me apart? I am an artist by education, holding a master's degree in art, painting, and graphics from the Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice. My works can be part of your collectible investment.",
